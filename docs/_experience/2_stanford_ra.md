misc: "<ul>
        <li>Developing robust deep learning models and GNC algorithms for vision-based rendezvous with known and unknown targets in space</li>
        <li>Developed and calibrated the Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) facility at SLAB that is capable of physically simulating spacecraft proximity operations with a mockup satellite mdodel under high-fidelity spaceborne illumination settings and estimating high-accuracy pose labels</li>
        <li>Developed the next-generation open-source datasets (e.g., SPEED+, SHIRT) using TRON to train and validate spaceborne vision-based deep learning and GNC algorithms with emphasis on robustness across domain gap</li>
        <li>Organized the <a href=\"https://kelvins.esa.int/pose-estimation-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">second international Satellite Pose Estimation Competition (SPEC2021)</a> in collaboration with the European Space Agency</li>
        </ul>"
