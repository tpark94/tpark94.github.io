I'm a PhD candidate advised by Dr. Simone D'Amico at the [Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB)](https://slab.stanford.edu) in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University. My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and spacecraft Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) for autonomous vision-based rendezvous and proximity operations in space. Specifically, my research covers the complete pipeline of machine learning development for spaceborne applications, from dataset generation and neural network design to on-ground validation and integration into GNC algorithms. Potential applications of my research include space situational awareness and logistics, such as active debris removal, inspection and refueling of defunct satellites.
